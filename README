Joe Pletcher - Assignment 1

Basic file encryption utility. Some stuff:
-AES128 is used in CBC mode. CBC mode was chosen for a few reasons
    *First, I understand it the best
    *Second, we are using gcrypt to select our IV, so randomness of IV's 
    should not be a problem
    *Additionally because of that, they should never be reused
    *Lastly, in the email you sent us, the input size was only a few hundred
    bytes, so I'm not sure if the advice there applies
-The first 16 bytes of the output file are the IV vector used. This is alright
 as far as I can tell, as the IV is non-secret
-Using a salt would probably not be a bad idea for the password
Or using something other than md5, but honestly probably doesnt matter too 
much
-You can adjust the DEBUG define in uocrypt.h if you want debugging output
